= Introduction =

Opengoss is an open-source based, full stack EMS/NMS platform.
It does not provide the end-user function, but provide the developer helpful function.


= Details =

1.A methodogy about MDA in EMS/NMS domain.

  There is a simplified model driven language in Opengoss Platform, it's business-oriented, and implementation-related model language. 

  We name this language as OML(Opengoss Model Language).
  
  OML combines the user's business and developer's implementations. It descripts the user's business from the developer's view.

  In fact, the model wroten by OML is not a pure PIM(Platform Independed Model), or PSM(Platform Specified Model), It's just an Opengoss co-related model language, it's between the PIM and PSM.

  OML orients the most populated architecture, it models the distributed computer system with a server role and client role (not CS architecture), client send request to the server by interfaces and models.
  
  The business model defined by OML includes: 

   (1).Domain Entity

   (2).Service Operations

   (3).Service Messages

   (4).Search/Retrieve Models.

2.A powerful runtime platform which can simplified the routine development work greatly.

3.An accumulated platform which can support a company or an organization to growth.
